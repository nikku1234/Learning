        Book
      </h1>
      <p>
        As stated earlier, the goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable
        foundation-level system. This includes all packages needed to
        replicate itself while providing a relatively minimal base from which
        to customize a more complete system based on the choices of the user.
        This does not mean that LFS is the smallest system possible. Several
        important packages are included that are not strictly required. The
        lists below document the rationale for each package in the book.
      </p>

              This package contains utilities to administer Access Control
              Lists, which are used to define more fine-grained discretionary
              access rights for files and directories.

              This package contains programs for producing shell scripts that
              can automatically configure source code from a developer's
              template. It is often needed to rebuild a package after updates

              This package satisfies an LSB core requirement to provide a
              Bourne Shell interface to the system. It was chosen over other
              shell packages because of its common usage and extensive
              capabilities beyond basic shell functions.

              This package implements a portable, high level programming
              interface to various calling conventions. Some programs may not
              know at the time of compilation what arguments are to be passed
              to a function. For instance, an interpreter may be told at
              run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
              given function. Libffi can be used in such programs to provide
              a bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.
