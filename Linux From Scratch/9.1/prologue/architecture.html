        <a id="pre-architecture" name="pre-architecture"></a>iii. LFS Target
        Architectures
      </h1>
      <p>
        The primary target architectures of LFS are the AMD/Intel x86
        (32-bit) and x86_64 (64-bit) CPUs. On the other hand, the
        instructions in this book are also known to work, with some
        modifications, with the Power PC and ARM CPUs. To build a system that
        utilizes one of these CPUs, the main prerequisite, in addition to
        those on the next page, is an existing Linux system such as an
        earlier LFS installation, Ubuntu, Red Hat/Fedora, SuSE, or other
        distribution that targets the architecture that you have. Also note
        that a 32-bit distribution can be installed and used as a host system
        on a 64-bit AMD/Intel computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        For building LFS, the gain of building on a 64-bit system compared to
        a 32-bit system is minimal. For example, in a test build of LFS-9.1
        on a Core i7-4790 CPU based system, using 4 cores, the following
        statistics were measured:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">Architecture Build Time     Build Size
32-bit       239.9 minutes  3.6 GB
64-bit       233.2 minutes  4.4 GB</code>
</pre>
      <p>
        As you can see, on the same hardware, the 64-bit build is only 3%
        faster and is 22% larger than the 32-bit build. If you plan to use
        LFS as a LAMP server, or a firewall, a 32-bit CPU may be largely
        sufficient. On the other hand, several packages in BLFS now need more
        that 4GB of RAM to be built and/or to run, so that if you plan to use
        LFS as a desktop, the LFS authors recommend building on a 64-bit
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default 64-bit build that results from LFS is considered a
        <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">pure</span>&rdquo;</span> 64-bit system. That is, it supports
        64-bit executables only. Building a <span class=
        "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">multi-lib</span>&rdquo;</span>
        system requires compiling many applications twice, once for a 32-bit
        system and once for a 64-bit system. This is not directly supported
        in LFS because it would interfere with the educational objective of
        providing the instructions needed for a straightforward base Linux
        system. Some LFS/BLFS editors maintain a fork of LFS for multilib,
        which is accessible at <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html</a>.
        But it is an advanced topic.
