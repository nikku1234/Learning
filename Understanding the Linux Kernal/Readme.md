Personally, I learned Kernel development by being knee deep in kernel code after I got fascinated with how different device drivers work. I had no previous experience and not much of guidance available. I just followed the mailing lists and was active in IRC, asking help when stuck. I believe you don't need a PhD in computer science or years of experience to hack the kernel. Sure, they help, but the nature of Linux development means that it's open to all by default. All you have to do is get stuck in.

IMHO, Linux Kernel Newbies, is the best resource for anyone who wants to get started in linux kernel development. It list out all the available resources and steps to get started for a newbie, who has know prior kernel experience. It consists of a helpful mailing list where you can ask almost any type of basic kernel development question. It also has an IRC channel that you can use to ask questions in real-time, and a lot of helpful documentation that is useful for learning about Linux kernel development. The website has basic information about code organization, subsystems, and current projects (both in-tree and out-of-tree). It also describes some basic logistical information, like how to compile a kernel and apply a patch.

If in case you like the dead tree version, I would recommend these three books, basically they cover all the information you would ever need to get started with Linux Kernel development.

Getting started with the Linux Kernel Development

The main point of this paragraph is to answer two questions: What to do and what not to do before sending your first patch to the Linux kernel. Please follow the steps listed here, they are exhaustive, skip the unnecessary oneâ€™s but I would prefer if you follow each and everyone of them. The tutorial involves set of steps to setup your dev environment to write a fresh kernel patch.

FirstKernelPatch - Linux Kernel Newbies

I believe in starting small, why not to fix relatively easy bugs as your first few patches. KernelJanitors - Linux Kernel Newbies. It is a great place to start. It describes a list of relatively simple problems that need to be cleaned up and fixed within the Linux kernel source tree. Working with the developers in charge of this project, you will learn the basics of getting your patch into the Linux kernel tree, and possibly be pointed in the direction of what to go work on next, if you do not already have an idea.

Once you are done with your training by writing few kernel patches, you would need a good source for kernel projects that need developers, you can find it here

Happy Hacking :)
